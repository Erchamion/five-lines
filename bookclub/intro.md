## About Me

* I've been with Leading Agile since October of 2017.  I've worked in Healthcare, Logistics, and now as a Consultant with Leading Agile.  I still program, at Leading Agile we have a few internal applications.  Mostly in the webstack area, Angular with .net core backends.  My current learning includes learning a programming language called Rust, love it, low level programing, memory safe, concurrently safe, reliable, performant.  I'm also interested in learning Elixer but one programming language at a time :D.  Other than programming languages I enjoy sharing things that I have learned and are pationate about like, code refactoring.
